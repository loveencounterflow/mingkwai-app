'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\n    my life!'\n\n    Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\n    leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But\n    everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in\n    she went.\n\n    Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n    glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,\n    and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\n    led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\n    had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\n    then she walked down the little passage: and THEN—she found herself at\n    last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\n    fountains.\n\n\n    Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n    much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n    into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n    that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n    those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n    doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\n    would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\n    shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'\n    For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\n    that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\n    impossible.\n\n    'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\n\n    'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\n    putting things!'\n\n    'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\n\n    'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n    everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And\n    the moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\n    yours.\"'\n\n    'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n    'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\n\n    'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that\n    is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more\n    simply--*Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n    appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\n    than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.*'\n\n    'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if\n    I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'\n\n    'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\n    a pleased tone.\n\n    'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\n    Alice.\n\n    'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present\n    of everything I've said as yet.'\n\n    'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give\n    birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out\n    loud.\n\n    'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n    little chin.\n\n    'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n    feel a little worried.\n\n    'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\n    the m--'\n\n    But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\n    in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\n    into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\n    in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n\n    'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n    'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n    ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in\n    about half no time! Take your choice!'\n\n    The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n    'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\n    too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n    croquet-ground.\n\n    The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\n    resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n    back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\n    cost them their lives.\n\n    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\n    the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her\n    head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\n    who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\n    the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\n    players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\n    under sentence of execution.\n\n    Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\n    you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n\n    'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n\n    'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n\n    'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n\n    'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\n\n    As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n    to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good\n    thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n    number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\n    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n    (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy\n    thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\n    Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n    executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\n    the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\n    the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\n    after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\n    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n    she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\n    half to itself, half to Alice.\n\n    'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n\n    'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never\n    executes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n\n    'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\n    after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\n\n    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n    sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n    nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n    pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\n    Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\n    fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n\n    So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n    full of tears, but said nothing.\n\n    'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\n    history, she do.'\n\n    'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\n    down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n\n    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n    herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\n    she waited patiently.\n\n    'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\n    Turtle.'\n\n    These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n    occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\n    heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n    saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\n    not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\n    nothing.\n\n    'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n    though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\n    sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n\n    'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n\n    'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle\n    angrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n\n    'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\n    added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n    Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\n    to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\n    and he went on in these words:\n\n    'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'\n\n    'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n\n    'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n    'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n    The Mock Turtle went on.\n\n    'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'\n\n    'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud\n    as all that.'\n\n    'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n    'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'\n\n    'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n    'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n\n    'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\n    a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n    \"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n\n\n    'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'\n    thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she\n    got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\n    Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\n    very queer indeed:--\n\n      ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n      \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\n      As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n      Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'\n\n      When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\n      And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\n      But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\n      His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.\n\n    'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the\n    Gryphon.\n\n    'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds\n    uncommon nonsense.'\n\n    Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\n    wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\n\n    'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n    'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next\n    verse.'\n\n    'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them\n    out with his nose, you know?'\n\n    'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully\n    puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n    'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it\n    begins \"I passed by his garden.\"'\n\n    Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\n    wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\n\n      'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\n      How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'\n\n      The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\n      While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\n      When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\n      Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\n      While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\n      And concluded the banquet--\n\n    'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle\n    interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most\n    confusing thing I ever heard!'\n\n    'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was\n    only too glad to do so.\n\n    'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went\n    on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'\n\n    'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice\n    replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n    'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old\n    fellow?'\n\n    The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\n    with sobs, to sing this:--\n\n       'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\n       Waiting in a hot tureen!\n       Who for such dainties would not stoop?\n       Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n       Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n       Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n         Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n       'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\n       Game, or any other dish?\n       Who would not give all else for two\n       Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n       Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n         Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n       Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n         Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'\n\n    'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\n    to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the\n    distance.\n\n    'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\n    off, without waiting for the end of the song.\n\n    'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\n    answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\n    came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--\n\n       'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n         Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'\n\n\n\n\n    ## CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?\n\n    The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n    arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\n    birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n    standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n    him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n    and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n    was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n    that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\n    trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\n    seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n    her, to pass away the time.\n\n    Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n    about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n    the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\n    herself, 'because of his great wig.'\n\n    The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n    wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n    not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\n    'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n    (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\n    animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\n    this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n    it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n    age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\n    just as well.\n\n    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\n    doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put\n    down yet, before the trial's begun.'\n\n    'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\n    fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'\n\n    'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n    hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\n    King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n    was talking.\n\n    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n    that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\n    and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n    'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\n    muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n\n    One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n    could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n    very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n    that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n    at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n    obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n    of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n    'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n\n    On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n    unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n\n       'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n          All on a summer day:\n        The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n          And took them quite away!'\n\n    'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n\n    'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great\n    deal to come before that!'\n\n    'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\n    blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'\n\n    The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\n    hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\n    Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\n    my tea when I was sent for.'\n\n    'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'\n\n    The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n    court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it\n    was,' he said.\n\n    'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\n\n    'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\n\n    'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n    wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n    reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\n    'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\n\n    'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.\n\n    'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\n    memorandum of the fact.\n\n    'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\n    my own. I'm a hatter.'\n\n    Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n    who turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n    'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\n    you executed on the spot.'\n\n    This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n    from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\n    his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n    bread-and-butter.\n\n    Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n    her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n    grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n    the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n    long as there was room for her.\n\n    'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n    next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'\n\n    'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\n\n    'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n\n    'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\n    too.'\n\n    'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\n    ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\n    other side of the court.\n\n    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n    just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n    of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\n    which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n\n    'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\n    executed, whether you're nervous or not.'\n\n    'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n    '--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\n    bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\n\n    'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n\n    'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n\n    'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you\n    take me for a dunce? Go on!'\n\n    'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\n    that--only the March Hare said--'\n\n    'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n    'You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n    'I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n    'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\n\n    'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\n    anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n    nothing, being fast asleep.\n\n    'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n\n    'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n    'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n    'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\n\n    The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n    down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\n\n    'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\n    Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n    the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n    explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n    up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n    head first, and then sat upon it.)\n\n\n    'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read\n    in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\n    at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\n    court,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.'\n\n    'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the\n    King.\n\n    'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'\n\n    'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\n\n    Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n    'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get\n    on better.'\n\n    'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\n    Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n    'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n    without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n    '--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the\n    officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\n    to the door.\n\n    'Call the next witness!' said the King.\n\n    The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in\n    her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\n    court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n\n    'Give your evidence,' said the King.\n\n    'Shan't,' said the cook.\n\n    The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n    'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\n\n    'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\n    after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\n    nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'\n\n    'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\n\n    'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n    'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!\n    Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\n    whiskers!'\n\n    For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\n    turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\n    disappeared.\n\n    'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next\n    witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,\n    YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead\n    ache!'\n\n    Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\n    curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't\n    got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when\n    the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\n    name 'Alice!'\n\n\n\n\n    ## CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence\n\n\n    'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\n    large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\n    a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n    upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n    they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\n    she had accidentally upset the week before.\n\n    'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n    began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\n    the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\n    that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\n    they would die.\n\n    'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until\n    all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with\n    great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\n\n    Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\n    the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n    tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got\n    it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said\n    to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\n    one way up as the other.'\n\n    As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\n    upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\n    them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\n    accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\n    anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\n    court.\n\n    'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.\n\n    'Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n    'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n    'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n    'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were\n    just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\n    interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a\n    very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\n\n    'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on\n    to himself in an undertone,\n\n    'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying\n    which word sounded best.\n\n    Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'\n    Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n    'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.\n\n    At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\n    his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule\n    Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\n\n    Everybody looked at Alice.\n\n    'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\n\n    'You are,' said the King.\n\n    'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\n\n    'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a\n    regular rule: you invented it just now.'\n\n    'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\n\n    'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.\n\n    The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your\n    verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\n    'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White\n    Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked\n    up.'\n\n    'What's in it?' said the Queen.\n\n    'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a\n    letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'\n\n    'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to\n    nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\n\n    'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.\n\n    'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's\n    nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\n    added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'\n\n    'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.\n\n    'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing\n    about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n    'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury\n    all brightened up again.)\n\n    'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they\n    can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'\n\n    'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter\n    worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your\n    name like an honest man.'\n\n    There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\n    clever thing the King had said that day.\n\n    'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.\n\n    'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know\n    what they're about!'\n\n    'Read them,' said the King.\n\n    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please\n    your Majesty?' he asked.\n\n    'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you\n    come to the end: then stop.'\n\n    These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\n\n       'They told me you had been to her,\n        And mentioned me to him:\n       She gave me a good character,\n        But said I could not swim.\n\n       He sent them word I had not gone\n        (We know it to be true):\n       If she should push the matter on,\n        What would become of you?\n\n       I gave her one, they gave him two,\n        You gave us three or more;\n       They all returned from him to you,\n        Though they were mine before.\n\n       If I or she should chance to be\n        Involved in this affair,\n       He trusts to you to set them free,\n        Exactly as we were.\n\n       My notion was that you had been\n        (Before she had this fit)\n       An obstacle that came between\n        Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\n       Don't let him know she liked them best,\n        For this must ever be\n       A secret, kept from all the rest,\n        Between yourself and me.'\n\n    'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the\n    King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'\n\n    'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large\n    in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting\n    him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of\n    meaning in it.'\n\n    The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an\n    atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\n\n    'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of\n    trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'\n    he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them\n    with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \"--SAID\n    I COULD NOT SWIM--\" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the\n    Knave.\n\n    The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he\n    certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n    'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over\n    the verses to himself: '\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's the jury, of\n    course--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why, that must be what he\n    did with the tarts, you know--'\n\n    'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"' said Alice.\n\n    'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\n    on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\"BEFORE SHE\n    HAD THIS FIT--\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the\n    Queen.\n\n    'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\n    as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\n    slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\n    began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\n    it lasted.)\n\n    'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court\n    with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n    'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\n    'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the\n    twentieth time that day.\n\n    'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\n\n    'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the\n    sentence first!'\n\n    'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n    'I won't!' said Alice.\n\n    'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\n    moved.\n\n    'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\n    time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\n\n    At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n    her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\n    tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n    head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n    leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n    'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've\n    had!'\n\n    'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her\n    sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\n    of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\n    finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,\n    dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So\n    Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n    what a wonderful dream it had been.\n\n    But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n    hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\n    wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\n    this was her dream:--\n\n    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n    hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\n    up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\n    queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\n    WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\n    listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\n    of her little sister's dream.\n\n    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\n    frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\n    could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n    shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n    ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\n    was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n    around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n    Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n    filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n    Turtle.\n\n    So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n    Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n    would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\n    wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\n    teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\n    cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\n    shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\n    knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\n    of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\n    heavy sobs.\n\n    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n    would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\n    keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\n    childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\n    make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\n    with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\n    all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\n    remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\n    \"\"\"\n\n"]}
