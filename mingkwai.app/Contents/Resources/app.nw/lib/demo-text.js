'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\nmy life!'\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But\neverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in\nshe went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\nthen she walked down the little passage: and THEN—she found herself at\nlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\nfountains.\n\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\ndoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\nshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'\nFor, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\nimpossible.\n\n'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\n\n'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\nputting things!'\n\n'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\n\n'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And\nthe moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\nyours.\"'\n\n'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\n\n'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that\nis--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more\nsimply--*Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.*'\n\n'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if\nI had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'\n\n'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\na pleased tone.\n\n'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\nAlice.\n\n'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present\nof everything I've said as yet.'\n\n'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give\nbirthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\n'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n\n'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\n'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m--'\n\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\nin the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\ninto hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\nin front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n\n'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!'\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\ncost them their lives.\n\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\nthe other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her\nhead!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\nunder sentence of execution.\n\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n\n'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n\n'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n\n'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n\n'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good\nthing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy\nthing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\nthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\nafter that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\n\n'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n\n'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n\n'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\nfancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\n\n'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.'\n\n'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\ndown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\nshe waited patiently.\n\n'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\nTurtle.'\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\nnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.\n\n'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n\n'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n\n'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n\n'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\nadded the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\nAlice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\nto the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\nand he went on in these words:\n\n'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'\n\n'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n\n'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\n\n'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'\n\n'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud\nas all that.'\n\n'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'\n\n'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n\n'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\na tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n\n\n'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'\nthought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she\ngot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:--\n\n  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n  \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\n  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'\n\n  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\n  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\n  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\n  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.\n\n'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the\nGryphon.\n\n'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.'\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\n\n'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next\nverse.'\n\n'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them\nout with his nose, you know?'\n\n'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it\nbegins \"I passed by his garden.\"'\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\n\n  'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\n  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'\n\n  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\n  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\n  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\n  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\n  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\n  And concluded the banquet--\n\n'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most\nconfusing thing I ever heard!'\n\n'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n\n'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went\non. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'\n\n'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old\nfellow?'\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:--\n\n   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\n   Waiting in a hot tureen!\n   Who for such dainties would not stoop?\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\n   Game, or any other dish?\n   Who would not give all else for two\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'\n\n'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the\ndistance.\n\n'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\n\n'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--\n\n   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?\n\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\nthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\ntrial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\nseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\nher, to pass away the time.\n\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\nherself, 'because of his great wig.'\n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\nnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\n'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\nthis last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\nit: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\nage knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\njust as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\ndoing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put\ndown yet, before the trial's begun.'\n\n'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\nfear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'\n\n'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\nhastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\nKing put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\nwas talking.\n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\nmuddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\nof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n\n   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n      All on a summer day:\n    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n      And took them quite away!'\n\n'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n\n'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great\ndeal to come before that!'\n\n'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\nblasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'\n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\nhand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.'\n\n'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'\n\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it\nwas,' he said.\n\n'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\n\n'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\n\n'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\n'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\n\n'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.\n\n'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\nmemorandum of the fact.\n\n'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\nmy own. I'm a hatter.'\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\nyou executed on the spot.'\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.\n\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\nlong as there was room for her.\n\n'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'\n\n'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\n\n'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n\n'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\ntoo.'\n\n'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\nridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\nother side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n\n'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.'\n\n'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\n\n'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n\n'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n\n'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!'\n\n'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\nthat--only the March Hare said--'\n\n'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n'You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n'I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\n\n'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\n'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n\n'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\n\n'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\n";
