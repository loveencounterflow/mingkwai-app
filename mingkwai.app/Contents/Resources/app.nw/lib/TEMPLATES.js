'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\nmy life!'", "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But\neverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in\nshe went.", "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\nthen she walked down the little passage: and THEN—she found herself at\nlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\nfountains.", "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\ndoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders. **愛麗絲** Oh, how I wish I could\nshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'\nFor, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\nimpossible.", "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\nbefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.", "It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\nsee whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\nbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\nforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is\nalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later."];
