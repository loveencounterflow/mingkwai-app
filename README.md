### Why Not TeX?

> TeX was one of the earliest typesetting systems, and had to make a lot of design decisions somewhat in a
> vacuum. Some of those design decisions have stood the test of time–and TeX is still an extremely well-used
> typesetting system more than thirty years after its inception, which is a testament to its design and
> performance–but many others have not. In fact, most of the development of TeX since Knuth’s era has
> involved removing his early decisions and replacing them with technologies which have become the industry
> standard: we use TrueType fonts, not METAFONTs (xetex); PDFs, not DVIs (pstex, pdftex); Unicode, not 7-bit
> ASCII (xetex again); markup languages and embedded programming languages, not macro languages (xmltex,
> luatex). At this point, **the parts of TeX that people actually \em{use} are 1) the box-and-glue model, 2)
> the hyphenation algorithm, and 3) the line-breaking algorithm**. [...]
> one of the things that TeX can’t do particularly well is typesetting on a grid. [...] There are various
> hacks to try to make it happen, but they’re all horrible.——[Simon Cozens, *SILE versus TeX*](http://www.sile-typesetter.org/what-is/index.html) (emphasis mine)
